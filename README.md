# What I learned through these eight hours?
  * AJAX requests via JS
  * componentWillMount(), componentWillUnmount() from ReactJS
  * rendering flow in ReactJS
  * hooking pressed keys
  * MaterialUI: AppBar, Drawer, Buttons, on*, TextField etc. (I was supposed to look in source code, because official docs were outdated)
  * axios by default send data as JSON, not application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  * custom theme in MaterialUI
